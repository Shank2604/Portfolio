            The prime objective of the weather forecasting web app is the ability display the
            weather minute basis accurately, hourly, daily, weekly and even monthly.
            <br>
            <br>
            The purpose of the Weather Forecast is to provide the details about the weather
            condition like :-
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Temperature
            <br>
            2. Description
            <br>
            3. Humidity
            <br>
            4. Wind speed.
            <br>
            <br>
            By using the weather forecasting website, people can easily know about the weather
            condition.
            <br>
            <br>
            Help people to plan their journey by looking the weather forecast.
            <br>
            <br>
            Weather forecasting is the application of current technology and science to predict the
            state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location.
            <br>
            <br>
            People can download thousands of weather apps on Apple App Store or Android
            Play store nowadays.
            <br>
            <br>
            Those apps show about present weather information and weather forecasts, with sleek
            and gorgeous interfaces.
            <br>
            <br>
            It seems itâ€™s unnecessary to design more weather applications, but I designed new one
            few days ago. Problems As I told you above, people can get various kinds of weather
            forecast apps. But those apps are all the same thing, except their design elements like
            color, icons, etc.
